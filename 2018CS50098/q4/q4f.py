print("When we assume our training data to be normally distributed and also if we further assume that both our classes have same spread that is co-variance matrix then in that case we have linear boundary obtained separating two classes. But if we don't assume this additional strong assumption and let our data tell us what is the co-variance matrix for each class then we end up with more general equation for the boundary. We allow our algorithm to learn from data. In case of less data given to us, we may over-fit the data in later approach while in former approach we may work good with less data.")
